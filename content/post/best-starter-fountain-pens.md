So, you want to get into the world of fountain pens? Well, there are thousands and thousands of different fountain pens out there, from a simple $3 pen to a $10000 Montblanc. If you are beginner to fountain pens, how do you navigate such a vast land of endless choices? Well, beginner pens are typically lower in price, have a firm fine or medium nib, and is generally very reliable.

This post serves as a list of my favorite beginner pens that I have tried myself. You will find some characteristics of each as well as the prices they can usually be found at.

###Platinum Preppy

The Platinum Preppy is a very inexpensive pen that performs way above the price point. It has a smooth nib and is very low maintenance. It can also be turned into an eyedropper if you wish.

* Very inexpensive (Retails at $3)
* Smooth and stiff nib (Fine and Medium available)
* Cartridge/Converter filling (Platinum proprietary)
* Lots of different colors (Black, Blue, Green, Red, Pink, Yellow, Violet)

The Pilot Metropolitan (also known as the Metro) is considered Pilot's entry line into their fountain pens. It is durable, rugged, and can take quite a beating. The nib is smooth like most other Pilot nibs.

* Relatively low priced (Retails at $14.50)
* Very smooth nib (Fine and Medium available)

The Jinhao X450 and X750 pens are extremely inexpensive all-metal Chinese fountain pens. The nibs are a bit of a hit-or-miss, but the designs and cheap price make up for it in my opinion.

* Very very low priced (Can be found for $1-$3)
* A hit-or-miss nib (about 70% of a good one)
* Cartridge/Converter (Standard international converter included)
* LOTS of different patterns and designs to choose
* Extremely durable all-metal construction

###Kaweco Sport and [Ice Sport](/kaweco-ice-sport-review/)
