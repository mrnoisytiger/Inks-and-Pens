I'd like to thank [Galen Leather](https://www.galenleather.com/) once again for sponsoring this review and giveaway of their Leather Zippered 3 Pen Case! They make some great leather products, such as pen cases, notebook covers, and folios, and you should check them out! They are a small two-person company, from Istanbul, Turkey specializing in handmade leather, wood, and brass products. You can find our previous review of their Leather Pen Roll [here](https://www.inksandpens.com/galen-leather-pen-roll-review/). **You can find a giveaway of the product featured on the bottom of the page.**

As someone who is always carrying a couple daily pens around with me, I'm always on the hunt for a new carrying case or otherwise. Well, Galen Leather's zippered pen case fit the bill, since I needed something that is compact and secure to store my pens throughout the day.

The pen case comes in Galen Leather's signature "vintage" cardboard box that we detailed our [previous review](https://www.inksandpens.com/galen-leather-pen-roll-review/), so you can check out the details there. Opening the box up, you'll find the pen case carefully wrapped in a cardboard strip, with some additional documentation under it.

For this particular piece, I opted to choose the "Crazy Horse" color, which is distinguishable by the rustic brown color and lighter "scratched" accents, which give the case a feel of wear and age. I really like this in person, as it adds a lot to the vintage look, without actually making the leather aged or whatnot. This is actually my favorite color in their line up so far!

Opening up the pen case, we are greeted by the star of the show, the velvet lined interior with space for three pens, held by elastic bands. Bands are quite tight, but still _very_ roomy. This let the case hold on to both my thinnest (Bic...) and thickest pen [(Visconti Homo Sapiens Bronze)](https://www.inksandpens.com/visconti-homo-sapiens-review/) without any fuss at all. Also, the velvet interior gave me peace-of-mind that the metal finishes of my pens would not get scratched. 

Though I'm a big fan of the elastic system, my only small gripe is the lack of a bottom elastic. Sometimes, when jostling the case with the three pens, the bottoms of the pens might get in contact with one another. Despite not being a terrible problem, I think it would be a bit better to have loops or elastics on the bottom, just for extra protection.
