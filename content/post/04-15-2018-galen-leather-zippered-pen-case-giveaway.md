I'd like to thank [Galen Leather](https://www.galenleather.com/) once again for sponsoring this review and giveaway of their Leather Zippered 3 Pen Case! They make some great leather products, such as pen cases, notebook covers, and folios, and you should check them out! They are a small two-person company, from Istanbul, Turkey specializing in handmade leather, wood, and brass products. You can find our previous review of their Leather Pen Roll [here](https://www.inksandpens.com/galen-leather-pen-roll-review/). **You can find a giveaway of the product featured on the bottom of the page.**

As someone who is always carrying a couple daily pens around with me, I'm always on the hunt for a new carrying case or otherwise. Well, Galen Leather's zippered pen case fit the bill, since I needed something that is compact and secure to store my pens throughout the day.

The pen case comes in Galen Leather's signature "vintage" cardboard box that we detailed our [previous review](https://www.inksandpens.com/galen-leather-pen-roll-review/), so you can check out the details there. Opening the box up, you'll find the pen case carefully wrapped in a cardboard strip, with some additional documentation under it.
