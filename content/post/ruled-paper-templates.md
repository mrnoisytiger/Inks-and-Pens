I often get asked if it is possible to turn a blank sheet of printer paper that is fountain pen friendly, such as the [HP 32lb Premium Choice Laser](/best-papers-for-fountain-pens/). A simple solution would be to print rulings (lines, graph, or dot) onto their paper of choice.

Personally, I print different rulings onto printer paper all the time, just for the versatility and cheapness of printer paper compared to other papers like Rhodia and Clairfontaine.

For all those out there that also want to print different rulings onto their papers, I've created a bunch of "ready-to-print" sheets of paper with a bunch of different rulings and spacings. Each PDF file below contains a two-sided "ready-to-print" document with the same ruling on both sides of the paper. I have included the popular US Letter size (8.5" x 11") and the European A4 size (21cm x 29.7cm). 

All templates have light gray lines with a border on the left and right sides of 0.3mm.

###How to Print

To print these sheets, simply download the file and print as you would any other document. In your printer settings, select to print it "double sided." If your printer does not have the double-sided option, print only the first page, put the printed sheets back into the paper tray with the printed part face-up, the print the second page. 

When printing, be sure to print your page as 100%, not as "Scale to fit paper" or a similar setting. The paper templates have at least 0.3" border, so the printer should not trim anything. 

I hope you guys find these templates useful! Let me know if you guys want any other types of ruling (Seyes, Isometric, etc...) or any other paper sizes and I'll try to update the list with them!
